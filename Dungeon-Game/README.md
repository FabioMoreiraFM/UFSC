# Dungeon-Game
A text-based game for Software Engineering

This project is a Frankenstein.
There are design patterns that we added over the semester and several quick fixes. =D <br>
It was my first contact with database too.

For database:

You need postgresql installed in your computer.

Create a table named 'teste' and add the tables in PostGresTable folder.

In the source code there are three parameters, make sure they are right:

dbname = teste <br>
username = postgres <br>
password = postgres <br>
